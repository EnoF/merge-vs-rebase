merge-vs-rebase
===============

A test project to display the advantages of rebasing over merging.

To display the advantages of rebasing over merging, I would need to add some more content to this `README.md`.

##Introduction
This introduction paragraph will be modified by the branch `intromod` and `introcon`. To display the effect an merge 
commit, we will create some commits in between.


The branch `jumping` will be 
having a conflict with this introduction paragraph for the first commit. The rest of the commits should not contain any 
further conflicts.
